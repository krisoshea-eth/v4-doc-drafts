# Transient State Library

The `TransientStateLibrary` is a crucial component of Uniswap V4, providing utility functions for managing transient state in the PoolManager contract. This library handles operations related to reserves, delta counts, and locking state, which are essential for the efficient and secure operation of the Uniswap V4 protocol.

## Key Concepts

### Transient Storage

Uniswap V4 uses transient storage to optimize gas costs and improve efficiency. Transient storage, introduced in EIP-1153, is a way to store data that is only needed for the duration of a transaction, without persisting it to the blockchain's state trie. This is achieved using the `TLOAD` and `TSTORE` opcodes.

Common operations that involve transient state include:

- Checking reserves (`getReserves`)
- Verifying currency deltas (`currencyDelta`)
- Syncing currency states (`sync`)
- Settling currency balances (`settle`)

### Storage Slots

The library defines constant storage slots for different pieces of transient state:

``` solidity
bytes32 public constant RESERVES_OF_SLOT = 0x1e0745a7db1623981f0b2a5d4232364c00787266eb75ad546f190e6cebe9bd95;
bytes32 public constant NONZERO_DELTA_COUNT_SLOT = 0x7d4b3164c6e45b97e7d87b7125a44c5828d005af88f9d751cfd78729c5d99a0b;
bytes32 public constant IS_UNLOCKED_SLOT = 0xc090fc4683624cfc3884e9d8de5eca132f2d0ec062aff75d43c0465d5ceeab23;
```

These slots are computed using `keccak256` hashes of specific strings, ensuring unique storage locations for each piece of data.

## Functions

### getReserves

``` solidity
function getReserves(IPoolManager manager, Currency currency) internal view returns (uint256)
```

Retrieves the reserves of a specific currency from the PoolManager's transient storage.

| Param Name   | Type         | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| manager | IPoolManager | The PoolManager contract instance
| currency | Currency | The currency for which to fetch reserves             |

**Returns:**
- `uint256`: The amount of reserves for the specified currency

**Notes:**
- Returns `0` if the reserves are not synced
- Returns `type(uint256).max` if the reserves are synced but the value is `0`

### getNonzeroDeltaCount

```solidity
function getNonzeroDeltaCount(IPoolManager manager) internal view returns (uint256)
```

Retrieves the count of nonzero deltas that must be zeroed out before the contract can be locked.

| Param Name   | Type         | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| manager | IPoolManager | The PoolManager contract instance

**Returns:**

- `uint256`: The number of nonzero deltas

### currencyDelta

```solidity
function currencyDelta(IPoolManager manager, address caller_, Currency currency) internal view returns (int256)
```

Fetches the current delta for a specific caller and currency from the PoolManager's transient storage.

| Param Name   | Type         | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| manager | IPoolManager | The PoolManager contract instance
| caller_ | address | The address of the caller
| currency | Currency | The currency for which to lookup the delta             |

**Returns:**

- `int256`: The delta value for the specified caller and currency

### isUnlocked

```solidity
function isUnlocked(IPoolManager manager) internal view returns (bool)
```

Checks if the PoolManager contract is currently unlocked.

| Param Name   | Type         | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| manager | IPoolManager | The PoolManager contract instance

**Returns:**

- `bool`: `true` if the contract is unlocked, `false` otherwise

## Usage and Importance
The `TransientStateLibrary` plays a critical role in Uniswap V4's operation:

1. **Gas Optimization:** By using transient storage, the library helps reduce gas costs associated with state changes that are only relevant within a single transaction. This is particularly important for multi-hop transactions, where internal net balances (deltas) are updated instead of making token transfers for each hop.
2. **Security:** The library provides functions to check the lock state and manage deltas, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the protocol during operations. The use of transient storage also allows for more efficient implementation of security measures compared to V3's reentrancy guards.
3. **Flexibility:** The library allows for efficient management of currency-specific data, such as reserves and deltas, which is essential for Uniswap V4's multi-currency pools.
4. **Encapsulation:** By centralizing these utility functions in a library, the code promotes better organization and reusability across the Uniswap V4 codebase.

## Integration with PoolManager

The `TransientStateLibrary` is designed to work closely with the `PoolManager` contract. All functions in this library take an `IPoolManager` instance as their first parameter, allowing them to interact with the PoolManager's transient storage.

## Security Considerations

When using this library, it's important to note:

1. The library relies on transient storage, which is cleared at the end of each transaction. Any critical state that needs to persist across transactions should not solely rely on this mechanism.
2. The `isUnlocked` function is crucial for ensuring that certain operations are only performed when the contract is in the correct state. Always check this before performing sensitive operations.
3. The `currencyDelta` function returns signed integers. Be careful when performing arithmetic with these values to avoid underflows or overflows.

By leveraging the `TransientStateLibrary`, Uniswap V4 achieves a balance between efficiency and security in managing its transient state, contributing to the overall robustness of the protocol.
